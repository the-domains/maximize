The business world is moving faster and becoming more global, more mobile, and more digitized. 
Companies need to become agile to cope with the current disruptive changes. 

For the last 15 years I've been helping companies grow their business, becoming more productive and agile, taking a leap at their competition using technology as a major driver. 

As Sales & Marketing Manager at Synergics I'm helping mide-size (SMB) and large companies to grow their business in this era of unprecedented digital transformation using mobile-, cloud-, big-data- and social solutions.
